        Did you know that if plaque covers teeth for longer than
            48 hours, then it begins to harden and can eventually become inflammation, bleeding, and gum disease?
            This can cause <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/conditions/periodontal-disease.html#:~:text=In%20its%20early%20stage%2C%20called,loosen%20or%20even%20fall%20out.">
            your teeth to fall out!</a> Additionally, failure to brush your teeth can turn them yellow and cause bad breath.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                It is so important to brush your teeth for this reason! 
                As a child, I hated brushing my teeth simply because I was told to do it and didn't want to. 
                This game is designed to teach children the importance of brushing
                their teeth in a fun way, so that they can have build healthy habits that will last their entire life.

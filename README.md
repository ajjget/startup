# START-UP WHACK-A-PLAQUE PROJECT

## Elevator Pitch
Whack-A-Mole is a classic game that has entertained children for generations. Dentists and parents alike want to teach children to brush their teeth daily so they can have good dental hygiene.

The premise of this game is very simple. There is a 3x3 grid of teeth covered in plaque. A toothbrush is used as a mallet to bonk the undesirable teeth back into their place. As the user plays this game, they understand that it is important to brush our teeth to keep them clean. When the player reaches 30 points, the game will end and nine clean teeth will emerge from all the holes. There is no way to lose the game, because the intent is that every player is a winner. Plaque-covered teeth with continue to pop up until 32 points are reached, because most adults have 32 teeth in their mouth.

This game could encourage better hygiene habits from children, and could be played from a browser on a personal computer or simply in the waiting room of a dentist's office.

## Key Features & How They Use Each Technology
HTML will be used for the basic formatting of the website. Text will be used to explain the premise of the game and how it's played. 

CSS will be used to make the game look pretty. I will use it to design the teeth and the toothbrush.

JavaScript will be used to make the game work. It will log points and control when and where the teeth pop up. It will keep track of when the game ends. It will make the toothbrush follow the cursor.

## Rough Sketches

This is how Whack-A-Plaque will look midgame.

## HTML Deliverable
- HTML pages -- Four HTML pages to accomodate logging in, playing, showing previous plays, and information
- Links -- All of the pages are accessible from one another
- Textual Content -- All of the textual content is input, and there is no 3rd party service required (as this is mentioned nowhere except this assignment and I'm not terribly sure what it means)
- Application images -- 
- Login -- Placeholder included on home page
- Database data placeholder -- Shown on "scores" page, where number of games played is displayed
- WebSocket realtime communicator -- Shown on "play" page, where the score is counted as teeth are brushed
